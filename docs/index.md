# Welcome

This is a test page for the mkdocs-live-wysiwyg-plugin.

Click **Edit** above to try the WYSIWYG editor.

## Admonition Support

The WYSIWYG editor supports MkDocs admonitions. In Markdown mode, use:

!!! note "Note"
    This is a note admonition.

!!! warning "Custom Title"
    Admonitions with custom titles work too.

This shows you what it's like to be awesome!

# Test

!!! danger "Danger"
    This is a note common in mkdocs.
